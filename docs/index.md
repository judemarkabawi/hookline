### Gameplay Features

- **First Section**: You’ll start off with a slower challenge, just trying to find your way up. It’s all about getting the hang of your grappling hook and exploring your surroundings.

- **Second Section**: Things get more challenging as you dodge projectiles flying your way. Keep moving!

- **Hazards**: Watch out for those red boxes — they’ll hurt you (and probably kill you) if you touch them. If you lose all your health, it’s game over.

- **Finale**: Reach the end, and jump off the cliff! You’ll enjoy a nice fall while taking in the scenery as you celebrate winning.
